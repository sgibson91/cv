    intro: >
      I am a core contributor and community leader for the following projects
    assignments:
      - title: Project Binder
        link: "https://mybinder.org"
        details: |
          I work as part of a team operating a website that serves reproducible
          computational environments in the cloud to approximately 140k users
          per week around the world. I maintain cloud infrastructure at the
          Turing Institute which receives a part of this traffic. I chair the
          monthly team meetings and onboard or mentor new contributors. I host
          workshops on using mybinder.org or deploying a replica service, and
          speak about Binder's community and role in the Open Science domain. At
          the Turing, I am technical lead and maintainer of a private Binder
          service for the Turing research community.

      - title: The Turing Way
        link: "https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way"
        details: |
          I am a core member of the team that launched the Turing Way as a book
          and project in 2019. I provide expert technical support for building
          the book website and continuous integration workflows. I also contribute
          my expertise directly to the book and have written chapters on Binder,
          facilitating remote events, and effective communication with an open
          source community. I mentor new contributors through the process of
          making their first contribution, guiding them on best practices and
          where their topic best fits into the book.
