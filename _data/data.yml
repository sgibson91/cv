    - role: Research Software Engineer
      time: 2018 - 2021
      company: <a href="https://turing.ac.uk">The Alan Turing Institute</a>, London UK
      details: |
        My role involved collaborating with stakeholders throughout the Turing
        network on research projects linked to the
        <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/challenges">Turing Challenge Areas</a>.
        In my capacity as an RSE, I took responsibility for following best software
        practices throughout projects, implementing required computational
        infrastructure or automated pipelines, data wrangling and analysis,
        project documentation, project management, and reporting via papers,
        presentations or blog posts.

        Within the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering">Research Engineering</a>
        team, I led two Service Areas that supported the project-based work the
        team and wider Turing research community engages in. The
        <b>Research Software Tools Management</b> service area provides access to
        critical research and collaboration tools including GitHub, continuous
        integration services, Zenodo, and the Slack workspace. The
        <b>Open Source</b> service area provides advice and mentoring for engaging
        with open source including developing open source tools and communities,
        publishing in open source journals
        (e.g. <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">JOSS</a>), and contributing to
        open source projects outside the Turing.

        <b>Notable projects:</b>

          - <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-handbook-reproducible-data-science">The Turing Way</a>

projects:
    title: Projects
    intro: >
      I am a core contributor and community leader for the following projects
    assignments:
      - title: Project Binder
        link: "https://mybinder.org"
        details: |
          I work as part of a team operating a public platform that serves
          reproducible computational environments to a global community. I
          wrote a successful bid for a $10k grant to deploy and maintain
          cloud infrastructure at the Turing Institute which receives a part
          of this traffic. I chair the monthly team meetings and onboard or
          mentor new contributors. I host workshops on using mybinder.org or
          deploying a replica service, and speak about Binder's community
          and role in the Open Science domain.

      - title: The Turing Way
        link: "https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way"
        details: |
          I am a core member of the team that launched the Turing Way as a book
          and project in 2019. I provide expert technical support for building
          the book website and continuous integration workflows. I also contribute
          my expertise directly to the book and have written chapters on Binder,
          facilitating remote events, and effective communication with an open
          source community. I mentor new contributors through the process of
          making their first contribution, guiding them on best practices and
          where their topic best fits into the book.

professional-activities:
    - role: Carpentries Instructor
      time: 2021 - ongiong
      company: <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a>
      details: |
        I am actively volunteering as a Software Carpentry Instructor.
        Being a Carpentries' Instructor has sharpened my skills in the following
        ways. I have:

        - developed my teaching abilities, through the Instructor training
          course I attended to certify as an Instructor
        - gained greater insight into and knowledge of the tools taught at
          workshops (git, Unix shell and Python)
        - managed interpersonal interactions with a wide range of learners from
          all backgrounds
        - gained useful perspectives and adaptability through teaching audiences
          with different levels of skill
        - developed research and teaching insights by instructing learners in
          disciplines other than my own
        - volunteered my time to help teach others computing skills because I
          believe in the importance of these skills to foster research
        - learned better time management to stay on top of all my commitments
        - deepened my understanding of equity and inclusion principles through
          Software Carpentry's ethos and Code of Conduct.

    - role: Fellow
      time: 2020 - ongoing
      company: <a href="https://software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a>
      details: |
        My Fellowship will promote the Binder community and diversify the
        skill set of the operating team. By attending conferences for Julia,
        Python and R (the 3 main Jupyter languages), I connect with these
        communities, learn how they use Binder and their future aspirations,
        and promote our onboarding system for becoming contributors and
        operators.

    - role: Mentor
      time: 2020 - ongoing
      company: <a href="https://openlifesci.org">Open Life Science</a>
      details: |
        This programme teaches open leadership skills for growing an open
        project and community through experiential learning and mentorship
        and I have successfully mentored projects through two cohorts.
